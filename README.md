# EvolutionalRockets

## About
This project is a simple genetic algorithm implementation wich I used to learn a little more about how these algorithms work.
The idea is that a set of "rockets" will improve their paths to avoid obstacles and reach a target. 

## Reference
This project was based on Daniel Shiffman's Smart Rockets (wich was based on a simulation by Jer Thorp).
